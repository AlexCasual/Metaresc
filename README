METARESC: META data and RESource library for C language

METARESC is a software library written in C programming language. It
allows declaring types using a special METARESC grammar. The variables
of types declared that way may be subsequently serialized into various
formats and deserialized later. To achieve this the library adds
metadata annotations to types. These annotations may be used for may
purposes far beyond just achieving the persistence.

How to build:

Install external dependencies autoconf, automake, libtool, pkg-config, flex, bison, libxml2-dev, check.
On Ubuntu, run the following command:
* apt-get install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config flex bison libxml2-dev check

Checkout Metaresc from github

* git clone https://github.com/alexanderchuranov/Metaresc.git

Run autoconf/automake generators:

* ./autogen.sh

Configure project for target system

* ./configure

Build and check library

* make check

On Windows one can use MinGW

Download MinGW installer from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download
Choose Basic Setup > mingw-developer-toolkit && mingw32-base

You will also need Bison v 3+ and pkg-config.
Download Bison and Flex from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/files/latest/download
Extract archive to user home dir in MSYS: c:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\UserName\ 
Download pkg-config from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pkgconfiglite/files/latest/download
Extract archive to c:\MinGW

Optionally you could intall libxml2-dev and check. It should be a similar process with prebuild binaries.

Having this minimal configuration you could build the library using standard autoconf/automake toolchain. 

Run autoconf/automake generators:

* ./autogen.sh

Configure project for target system

* CFLAGS=-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO HAVE_BISON=yes HAVE_FLEX=yes YACC=~/win_flex_bison3-latest/win_bison.exe LEX=~/win_flex_bison3-latest/win_flex.exe ./configure

Build and check library

* make check
