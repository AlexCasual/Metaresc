METARESC: META data and RESource library for C language

METARESC is a software library written in C programming language. It
allows declaring types using a special METARESC grammar. The variables
of types declared that way may be subsequently serialized into various
formats and deserialized later. To achieve this the library adds
metadata annotations to types. These annotations may be used for may
purposes far beyond just achieving the persistence.
